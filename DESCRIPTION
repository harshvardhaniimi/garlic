Title: Some R Functions I Use Rather Frequently
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Harshvardhan <hello@harsh17.in>
Maintainer: Harshvardhan <hello@harsh17.in>
Description: These are some functions that I use very frequently in my projects. There are three
    categories of functions: exploratory functions to check missing values and describe data,
    visualisation functions for my ggplot2 themes and manipulative functions to modify selected 
    variables. See vignette for more details.
